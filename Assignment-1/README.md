# Assignment 1 - Assembly Language

This assignment served as an introduction to working with assembly language, using ToyRISC instruction set architecture. ToyRISC ISA is a reduced instruction set architecture with basic assembly language commands. In this assignment, we have written the following programs in assembly language.

* A program to check whether a number is even or odd.
* A program to sort an array of numbers at a given address in memory.
* A program to place first 'n' Fibonacci numbers at a particular memory location.
* A program to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not.
* A program to check whether a given number is prime or not.
